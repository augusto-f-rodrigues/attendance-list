A attendance list made with React JS :pushpin:

First project with React JS, to learn more about the hooks and how the things works in the React, to configure the app I used the Vite.
It is a simple attendance list, the information about the user in the top-right corner I get from the github API and the elements or cards can be added writting the name and clicking in the "Add" button, the date is get from the navigator.
